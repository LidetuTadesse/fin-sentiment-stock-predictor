This project focuses on understanding how public sentiment influences stock market behavior. It scrapes or imports sentiment from news headlines and applies natural language processing techniques to extract sentiment scores, and then uses machine learning models to predict stock price movements. The goal is to integrate data-driven sentiment signals with price data for improved market forecasting.
